## 4.1 The Heart of the Ecosystem: Contribution Positions
Instead of relying exclusively on a governance token, the Pandora's ecosystem is centered around **"Contribution Positions"**.
* **Definition:** When an investor contributes capital to a project, they get a position proportional to their investment. This position, registered in our system, is the reference unit for calculating returns and rights, without the need for an additional digital token for this purpose.
* **Benefits:**
    * Direct participation in the yields and returns of the invested project.
    * Early access to new investment opportunities.
    * Priority rights in future rounds or special projects.
    * Participation in a portion of the fees generated by the platform.

## 4.2 The PBox Utility Token: Enhancing the Experience
In a complementary role, the ecosystem will feature the native **PBox** token, designed to function as a utility token.
* **Utility:**
    * **Rewards and Staking:** Holders can receive additional rewards.
    * **Yield Boosters:** Allows applying "boosters" to enhance the performance of certain investments.
    * **Preferential Access:** Grants priority access to the most exclusive projects.
    * **Fee Benefits:** Discounts on platform fees.

## 4.3 The Return Cycle: A Sustainable Ecosystem
The Pandora's economy is designed as a virtuous and sustainable cycle:
1.  **Investment:** Users contribute capital to audited projects.
2.  **Tokenization and Liquidity:** Projects receive funding, and investors get digital assets.
3.  **Revenue Generation:** Projects generate returns (e.g., rents, sales, capital gains).
4.  **Treasury Funding:** A portion of the generated revenue feeds the Pandoras Finance treasury.
5.  **Profit Distribution:** The treasury redistributes profits among the holders of Contribution Positions, incentivizing long-term participation.
6.  **Re-investment:** Investors can use their returns to reinvest in new projects, closing the cycle.

## 4.4 PBox Token Sale and Distribution Proposal
The initial sale of the PBox token is planned in three staggered phases to encourage early adoption.
* **Phase 1:** Private Sale (Family & Friends).
* **Phase 2:** Pre-sale (Early Adopters).
* **Phase 3:** Public Sale.

*(Note: The detailed token distribution—percentage for the team, treasury, marketing, etc.—will be defined in a later version of this document).*
