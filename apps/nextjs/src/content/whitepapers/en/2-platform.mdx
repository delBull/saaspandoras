## 2.1 Pandora's Ecosystem Architecture
Our platform is designed as a comprehensive workflow that combines three fundamental pillars: **Audit + Feasibility + Tokenization**. This approach ensures that only projects with the highest potential and veracity reach investors, minimizing risk and maximizing trust.

### 2.2 Blockchain Infrastructure: An Evolutionary Strategy

#### 2.2.1 Stage 1: Operation on Base Chain
Initially, we will operate on the **Base** blockchain. The choice of Base is based on its high efficiency, low transaction costs, and robust ecosystem, making it ideal for the frequent operations our platform requires.

#### 2.2.2 Stage 2: Migration to AGOD Chain
In the future, we plan to migrate a significant part of the ecosystem to **AGOD Chain**, our own blockchain. This transition will grant us greater control, robustness, and scalability, allowing us to natively integrate advanced auditing and asset management modules.

### 2.3 Token Standards and Their Applications
We use a multi-standard approach to accurately represent each type of asset and right.

#### 2.3.1 ERC-20 (Fungible Tokens)
They represent fractional and interchangeable shares of an asset.
* **Use case:** Tokenized shares of a startup, square meters of a real estate development, or shares in an investment fund. They enable liquidity and trading.

#### 2.3.2 ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Tokens - NFTs)
They represent ownership of a unique and complete asset or special rights.
* **Use case:** The title deed of a complete property, a patent, a license, or exclusive memberships that grant preferential access to future projects.

#### 2.3.3 ERC-1155 (Hybrid Tokens)
This standard allows for the management of fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same smart contract.
* **Use case:** A real estate presale where ERC-20 tokens are issued for fractional investment and, simultaneously, ERC-721 NFTs grant premium rights (like choosing finishes or access to exclusive amenities).

## 2.4 The Key Differentiator: The "PBox Sheet" Audit System
Our main differentiator is the project validation system, based on the **"PBox Sheet"** methodology.
* **Process:** Project promoters must complete a standardized form that collects crucial strategic information: financial model, market analysis, risks, team, etc.
* **AI Validation:** An Artificial Intelligence analyzes this data to rate the project's feasibility and veracity, ensuring a high-quality filter.
* **Evolution:** The process begins in-person and semi-automated to ensure maximum quality in the initial stage, with the goal of migrating to a fully automated system that allows for global scaling.
