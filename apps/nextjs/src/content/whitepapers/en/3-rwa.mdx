## 3.1 Project Verification and Onboarding Process
1.  **Application:** The project completes and submits the PBox Sheet.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The AI performs an initial feasibility and risk assessment.
3.  **Human Audit (Initial Phase):** Our team conducts an on-site and documentary audit to validate the information.
4.  **Approval:** Once approved, the project is queued to be legally and technically structured for tokenization.

## 3.2 Legal Structure, Custody, and Regulatory Compliance
* **Custody:** Physical assets (e.g., properties, shares) are held in custody by regulated **fiduciary entities**. This ensures that each token has a real and verifiable backing until all project obligations are met.
* **Compliance:** We operate as a **LLC (Limited Liability Company)** and strictly adhere to **KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** regulations to ensure the security and transparency of all operations.

## 3.3 The Technical Process of Tokenization
1.  **Asset Selection:** An asset validated by the PBox Sheet is chosen, based on its market potential and regulatory viability.
2.  **Standard Definition:** The most suitable token standard (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) for the asset is determined.
3.  **Blockchain Selection:** The network for issuance is chosen (Base in the initial stage, AGOD Chain in the future).
4.  **Off-Chain Data Synchronization:** **Oracles** and **Proof of Reserve (PoR)** services are used to link the physical asset with its digital representation, continuously verifying its existence and value.
5.  **Token Issuance:** The smart contract is deployed and the tokens are minted (issued), then distributed to investors.
